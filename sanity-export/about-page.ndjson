Nestled around the village of Calstock, the River Tamar has been central to local life for centuriesâ€”once a vital artery for transport and trade, and now a cherished space for recreation and a haven for diverse wildlife.\n\nRecognizing its importance, our community came together with a shared vision: to protect and restore the river for current and future generations.",
