Below is a compact, source-grounded content pack you can lift into Astro/Sanity (or WordPress) as page copy and sidebars. I’ve folded the site’s current voice, added Tamar-specific facts, and included “drop-in” blocks for a Results page and a Live Conditions panel. Citations anchor the key claims.

Drip Drip Tamar — Content Reference Pack

1. One-line purpose (strapline)

Working towards a healthy Tamar River — with clear data, practical guidance, and community action. ￼

2. Short mission (homepage hero)

Drip Drip is a community group based around Calstock, sharing professional water-testing results in plain English and advocating for cleaner, safer waterways across the Tamar. We sample weekly, publish what we find, and work with our neighbours and decision-makers to improve river health. ￼

Quick actions (homepage buttons)
• See the latest results (weekly bacteria data)
• Check storm overflows on WaterFit Live (near-real-time map) ￼
• Read the news & updates (sampling, events, guidance) ￼

⸻

3. The Tamar — where we work (About page context)
   • The River Tamar runs ~61 miles (98 km), forming most of the historic boundary between Devon (east) and Cornwall (west), flowing into Plymouth Sound. A large part of the valley is protected as the Tamar Valley National Landscape (formerly AONB) and parts fall within a UNESCO World Heritage mining landscape. ￼ ￼
   • The lower Tamar/Tavy estuary is an SSSI and part of the Plymouth Sound & Estuaries protected complex, important for wintering wildfowl and waders. ￼
   • Allis shad: the Tamar at Gunnislake Weir is the UK’s only known breeding site for this critically endangered migratory fish; improving fish passage here is an active project focus in the catchment. ￼ ￼
   • Nearby, the Calstock Flood Defence & Intertidal Habitat scheme (completed 2021) created ~11 ha of new wetlands by reconnecting the river to its floodplain — now monitored by scientists. ￼ ￼

4. What we do (About page sections)

Monitoring

We collect river samples at regular sites near Calstock (e.g., Okel Tor and Calstock Quay) and send them for accredited laboratory testing for two faecal-indicator bacteria: E. coli and intestinal enterococci. These help indicate sewage and runoff contamination. ￼

Community

We run stalls and take part in local events (e.g., Tamar Valley River Festival), share results, and encourage safer river use — especially after rain. ￼

Action & Advocacy

We raise issues highlighted by our data (e.g., overflows, runoff), and signpost the public to live overflow information (WaterFit Live) while pressing for upstream fixes. ￼

⸻

5. Safety guidance (site-wide sidebar or FAQ)
   • Rain matters. Heavy rain washes contaminants from urban and rural land into rivers and can coincide with storm overflow activations. The EA also issues daily pollution risk forecasts for designated bathing waters. ￼ ￼
   • General public-health advice: pay attention to local warnings, avoid swallowing water, cover cuts, and avoid cloudy/dirty water — especially after heavy rain. ￼ ￼
   • Check before you enter: look at WaterFit Live for current overflow activity. ￼

Note: Drip Drip results are advisory for local decision-making; official Bathing Water classifications are based on four years of samples at designated sites. ￼

6. Results page — ready copy

Understanding our river water test results

We publish weekly measurements for E. coli and intestinal enterococci at our sampling points near Calstock. These indicators help you judge short-term risk from swimming, paddling or other contact — particularly after rainfall. ￼ ￼

Why rainfall changes the picture
After rain, runoff and storm overflows can sharply increase bacteria levels for a time; conditions usually improve as the river flushes through. Always check recent rainfall and WaterFit Live before you go in. ￼ ￼

How to read the chart
• We plot both bacteria types by date and location.
• Guide bands reflect common thresholds used for designated bathing waters (e.g., E. coli 500/1,000 cfu/100 ml; enterococci 200/400 cfu/100 ml). These are indicative ranges to help interpretation; official classifications use multi-year percentiles. ￼

Key takeaways
• Dry spells typically coincide with lower readings.
• After rain, risk increases until levels fall back.
• Check live overflows and read the latest results before entering. ￼

Data note
Our sampling complements (not replaces) official monitoring. For designated coastal bathing waters near the Tamar, see the EA’s profiles and daily forecasts in season. ￼

7. “Live conditions” panel (optional widget copy)
   • Rain (last 24–72 h) — nearby EA gauges
   • River level trend — Tamar at/near Calstock
   • Overflow status — link to WaterFit Live catchment page

These three tiles can draw data from the EA Flood-monitoring API (levels/flows/rainfall) and the SWW WaterFit Live map (view & link). ￼ ￼

⸻

8. Local features (About/News snippets)
   • Okel Tor & Calstock sit within a nationally important landscape with rich mining heritage and wildlife. The new Calstock Wetlands (adjacent to Okel Tor) adds saltmarsh and reedbed habitat for birds and other species. ￼ ￼
   • Allis shad at Gunnislake Weir — unique UK spawning population; plans are progressing to improve fish passage. Use this as an educational sidebar when the fish run is expected. ￼

⸻

9. News/blog seeding ideas (editorial calendar)
   • “What last week’s rain did to bacteria levels” — pair your chart with EA rainfall totals and a short explanation. ￼
   • “How to use WaterFit Live (and what it can’t tell you)” — explain overflow indicators and limitations. ￼
   • “Why the new Calstock wetlands matter” — link monitoring & habitat benefits. ￼ ￼
   • “Allis shad on the Tamar” — short natural-history explainer + fish-pass update. ￼

⸻

10. Tone & style (house rules)
    • Plain, precise British English.
    • Lead with what people can do (check rain/overflows; read latest results).
    • Use numbers sparingly but clearly (cfu/100 ml).
    • Be honest about uncertainty and limits (single-day samples, non-designated sites).

⸻

11. Social proof & community (optional pull-quotes)
    • Website launch & weekly updates via your News page. ￼
    • Presence at local events (e.g., River Festival) and regular public comms. ￼
    • Ongoing Facebook updates on overflows and site progress (use as “Latest from Facebook” feed). ￼ ￼

⸻

12. Useful links (for footer or “Resources” page)
    • WaterFit Live — storm overflow map (Tamar catchment). ￼
    • EA Flood-monitoring API & public levels/rainfall pages (for your Live panel). ￼ ￼
    • EA Bathing Water classifications & how they work. ￼
    • Tamar Valley National Landscape (background/explore). ￼

13. Page-ready snippets (copy blocks)

Homepage — “What we do”

Monitoring — We take weekly river samples for professional lab testing to track E. coli and intestinal enterococci.
Action — We share results, flag risks (especially after rainfall), and push for fixes.
Community — We host events and work with neighbours across the valley. ￼

About — “Our story”

Drip Drip began after a People’s Assembly raised serious community concerns about the Tamar’s condition. Based around Calstock, we aim to protect and restore the river for people and wildlife through monitoring, public guidance and constructive advocacy. ￼

Results — “Before you swim or paddle”
• Check WaterFit Live for any current storm overflows. ￼
• Avoid entering after heavy rain until levels improve.
• Read our latest results and notes for context. ￼

Results — “How classification works (brief)”

Official bathing-water status uses four years of samples at designated sites and statistical percentiles; a single high or low reading doesn’t define overall status. Our weekly data is intended to inform local choices. ￼

⸻

14. Optional “Live Conditions” micro-copy (UI labels)
    • Rain (24h/72h) — EA gauge: x mm (↑/↓ vs. weekly avg)
    • River level — Calstock: x m and rising/falling
    • Overflows — See WaterFit Live catchment map →

Notes on alignment with your current site

The pack keeps your existing headlines and intent (“Working towards a healthy Tamar River”), adds geographic/ecological context (AONL/SSSI; allis shad), and integrates official guidance on rainfall and bathing-water forecasts. It also reflects your ongoing presence in community comms and events. ￼ ￼

If you want, I can drop these into page-by-page blocks sized for Sanity fields (H2/H3 + paragraph granularity), and wire a Live Conditions Astro endpoint against EA data so editors can toggle the panel per page.
