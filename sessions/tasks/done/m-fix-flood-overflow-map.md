# Fix Flood Overflow Map Live Data Integration

## Problem/Goal
The flood overflow map is not pulling live data correctly. There is an existing overflow chart on the results page that successfully pulls and displays the correct data. We need to investigate the working chart implementation and use that setup to fix the map's data integration.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Investigate and document how the existing overflow chart pulls data
- [x] Identify differences between the chart and map implementations
- [x] Fix the map to pull live data correctly
- [x] Verify map displays accurate, real-time flood overflow data
- [x] Test data updates are reflected in the map in real-time
- [x] Ensure both chart and map use consistent data fetching approach

## Context Files
<!-- Added by context-gathering agent or manually -->

## User Notes
<!-- Any specific notes or requirements from the developer -->
- Working overflow chart exists on results page
- Chart appears to pull correct data successfully
- Investigate chart setup to understand correct implementation
- Apply similar approach to fix the map component
