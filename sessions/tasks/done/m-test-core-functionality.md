# Add Automated Tests for Core Functionality

## Problem/Goal
Add comprehensive automated tests for currently untested core functionality in the Astro + Sanity CMS application. While basic test infrastructure exists with good coverage for Sanity client configuration, image utilities, and page rendering, significant gaps exist in testing the News/Blog system and Water Quality data transformation features.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Water Quality tests created - 31 unit tests for data transformation and chart configuration with comprehensive edge case coverage
- [x] News System tests created - 62 tests (35 Portable Text + 27 News Rendering) covering all transformation and rendering logic
- [x] All tests passing - 124 total tests pass successfully with zero errors
- [x] Coverage maintained/improved - Coverage: waterQuality.js 92.2%, portable-text.ts 100%, overall utils 96.95%

## Context Manifest

### How the Test Infrastructure Currently Works

This codebase has a well-established testing infrastructure using **Vitest** as the test framework with JSDOM environment for DOM operations. The test setup follows a clear organization pattern with separate directories for unit and integration tests, along with centralized test configuration and setup utilities.

**Test Configuration and Setup Flow:**

The test system begins with `vitest.config.ts` which defines the global test environment. When any test runs, Vitest first loads the setup file at `tests/setup/setup.ts` which establishes the baseline testing environment. This setup file performs critical initialization:

1. **Polyfills**: Adds TextEncoder/TextDecoder polyfills for Node.js environment (lines 7-12) - this fixes esbuild compatibility issues where `TextEncoder instanceof Uint8Array` would fail
2. **Environment Mocking**: Stubs core Sanity environment variables (`SANITY_PROJECT_ID`, `SANITY_DATASET`, `SANITY_TOKEN`) using Vitest's `vi.stubEnv()` (lines 14-17)
3. **Global Mocks**: Mocks `fetch` globally for API calls and console methods to reduce test noise (lines 19-30)
4. **Cleanup**: Automatically clears all mocks between tests via `afterEach` hook (lines 33-35)

The configuration uses `pool: 'forks'` to run tests in isolated processes, preventing cross-contamination between test suites. Coverage reporting is configured with v8 provider, outputting text, JSON, and HTML reports while excluding node_modules, build artifacts (.astro/, dist/), studio files, config files, and test files themselves from coverage metrics.

**Existing Test Patterns:**

Looking at `tests/unit/sanity-image.test.ts`, we see the established unit testing pattern:
- Deep mocking of external dependencies (the @sanity/image-url builder is completely mocked with a chain-able fluent API, lines 16-57)
- The mock simulates the actual API by building URLs with query parameters tracked via URLSearchParams
- Tests verify both behavior (function calls) and output (generated URLs)
- Edge cases are systematically tested (null values, invalid inputs, different data shapes)

The integration test pattern in `tests/integration/page-rendering.test.ts` shows a different approach:
- Mocks entire data fetching modules (`src/data/page`, `src/data/siteConfig`) at the module level (lines 4-49)
- Uses vi.mock() to intercept imports and return controlled test data
- Tests focus on data structure validation rather than implementation details
- Includes error handling scenarios (lines 182-198) to verify graceful degradation

**Test Execution Model:**

Tests can be run in multiple modes:
- `npm run test` - Single run of all tests (used in CI)
- `npm run test:unit` - Only unit tests in tests/unit/
- `npm run test:integration` - Only integration tests in tests/integration/
- `npm run test:watch` - Watch mode for development
- `npm run test:coverage` - With coverage reports
- `npm run test:ui` - Opens Vitest UI for interactive testing

The test suite integrates with the overall quality pipeline via `npm run test:all` which runs linting, type checking, build validation, and finally the test suite - this ensures all quality gates pass before deployment.

### How Water Quality Data Transformation Works

The water quality system fetches real-time data from Sanity CMS and transforms it into Chart.js-compatible format for interactive data visualization. This is a critical feature for displaying environmental monitoring data to end users.

**Data Fetching Architecture:**

The system begins in `src/data/waterQuality.js` with three GROQ queries (lines 7-46):
1. `SAMPLES_QUERY` - Fetches all water samples ordered by date descending with denormalized site information
2. `SAMPLES_RANGE_QUERY` - Parameterized query for date-range filtering
3. `SITES_QUERY` - Fetches all sampling site metadata

These queries use Sanity's reference resolution (`site->title`, `site->slug.current`) to denormalize the data at query time, avoiding the need for client-side joins. The functions `getWaterSamples()`, `getWaterSamplesInRange()`, and `getSamplingSites()` (lines 52-86) wrap these queries with error handling that returns empty arrays on failure rather than throwing - this ensures the UI degrades gracefully if CMS is unavailable.

**Critical Data Transformation Logic - transformSamplesToChartData():**

This function (lines 91-147) transforms raw Sanity data into Chart.js line chart format. The transformation is complex due to special requirements:

1. **Label Generation** (lines 93-144):
   - Extracts unique dates and sites from the samples
   - Formats dates using `toLocaleDateString('en-GB')` with specific format: "day numeric, month short, year 2-digit" (e.g., "15 Jan 25")

2. **Dataset Construction** (lines 96-137):
   - Creates TWO datasets per site (one for E. coli, one for Enterococci)
   - Each site/bacteria combination becomes a separate line on the chart
   - For each dataset, maps dates to values by finding the matching sample (lines 106-108, 124-126)

3. **Log Scale Value Clamping** (lines 109-112, 127-130):
   - This is CRITICAL: Chart.js cannot display zero or negative values on logarithmic scales
   - `null` or `undefined` values are preserved as null (Chart.js will skip these points, creating gaps)
   - Values less than 1 are clamped to 1 to maintain visibility on the log scale
   - This prevents data loss while ensuring chart doesn't error when encountering 0 values

4. **Visual Differentiation** (lines 133):
   - Enterococci datasets use dashed lines (`borderDash: [5, 5]`) to distinguish from solid E. coli lines
   - Color application happens CLIENT-SIDE in WaterQualityChart.astro (lines 196-223) after Unicode normalization

5. **Unicode Normalization Issue**:
   - Site names may contain invisible Unicode characters in labels
   - The component uses regex `/[\u200B-\u200D\uFEFF\u00A0\u202F\u205F\u3000]/g` (line 216) to strip these before color matching
   - This prevents the color mapping from failing due to character encoding differences

**Chart Configuration - getChartConfig():**

This function (lines 152-328) returns a complete Chart.js options object with extensive customization:

1. **Annotation Zones** (lines 156-264):
   - If `showThresholds` is true, creates background color zones representing EU Bathing Water Quality standards
   - Four quality zones: Excellent (0-500), Good (500-1000), Sufficient (1000-1800), Poor (1800-100000)
   - Each zone has a semi-transparent background color (rgba with 0.08 alpha)
   - Separate threshold lines for E. coli (solid, 5-5 dash) and Enterococci (lighter, 3-3 dash)
   - Values: E. coli thresholds at 500, 1000, 1800; Enterococci at 200, 400, 660

2. **Responsive Design** (lines 267-270):
   - `maintainAspectRatio: false` allows manual height control
   - `aspectRatio: 2.5` provides default ratio when not constrained
   - Component sets explicit height via style attribute (line 59)

3. **Logarithmic Y-Axis** (lines 309-325):
   - Critical for accommodating extreme outliers (values can range from <10 to 100,000+)
   - Custom tick callback (lines 317-323) only shows labels at 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000 to prevent clutter
   - Axis label clearly indicates "log scale" to prevent user confusion

4. **Interaction Mode** (lines 271-292):
   - `mode: 'index'` means hovering shows ALL datasets at that x-position
   - Tooltip callback formats values with "cfu/100ml" units and handles null values
   - This allows comparing both sites and both bacteria types simultaneously

**Component Integration:**

`src/components/WaterQualityChart.astro` brings it all together:
- Fetches data at **build time** (line 24): `const samples = await getWaterSamples();`
- Transforms data immediately (line 25)
- Uses Intersection Observer (lines 186-246) to lazy-load Chart.js only when chart scrolls into view
- Chart.js is loaded from a global `window.loadChart()` function (assumed to be in layout)
- After loading, applies colors client-side because the normalization must happen in browser context

### How the News/Blog System Works

The news system is a complete blog implementation with post rendering, portable text transformation, SEO optimization, and responsive image handling. It consists of list and detail pages with shared data transformation logic.

**Content Model Architecture:**

The post content type is defined in `studio/schemaTypes/postType.ts` with two field groups:
1. **Content Group** (default): title, slug, excerpt (max 200 chars), author (reference to person), publishedAt (datetime with auto-initialization), featuredImage (customImage type), body (portable text array)
2. **SEO Group**: seoTitle (max 60 chars), seoDescription (max 160 chars), seoKeywords (comma-separated)

The body field uses Sanity's portable text format: an array of block objects where each block has `_type: 'block'`, a `style` property (h1, h2, h3, h4, blockquote, or normal), and `children` array containing span objects with text and optional marks (strong, em, underline, code).

**News Listing Page Flow (`src/pages/news.astro`):**

1. **Data Fetching** (lines 9-29):
   - GROQ query fetches all published posts with defined slugs, ordered by `publishedAt desc`
   - Denormalizes author reference to just the name string
   - Fetches featuredImage with asset reference AND dimensions from metadata

2. **Portable Text Excerpt Generation** (lines 32-51):
   - Function `extractTextFromPortableText()` strips all formatting and extracts plain text
   - Filters to only 'block' type elements, then maps over children to extract span text
   - Joins all text blocks with spaces, truncates to maxLength (default 200), adds ellipsis if truncated
   - This is used as fallback when post.excerpt is not provided

3. **Content Transformation** (lines 54-77):
   - Maps posts to card format for display
   - Uses excerpt if available, otherwise calls `extractTextFromPortableText(post.body, 150)`
   - Creates actionLink to `/news/${slug.current}`
   - Adds badge with author attribution if author exists

4. **Date Formatting** (lines 79-87):
   - Formats publishedAt using `toLocaleDateString('en-GB')` with format: "day numeric, month short, year numeric" (e.g., "15 Jan 2025")
   - Empty string if no publishedAt (unpublished posts)

5. **Component Rendering** (lines 109-131):
   - Maps over posts using `PostListItem` component
   - Passes image data structure that ResponsiveImage expects: `{ asset, dimensions, alt }`
   - This structure matches what getImageUrl() in sanity-image.ts requires

**Post Detail Page Flow (`src/pages/news/[slug].astro`):**

1. **Static Path Generation** (lines 9-19):
   - `getStaticPaths()` fetches all posts with defined slugs at build time
   - Returns array of `{ params: { slug } }` for Astro to generate static routes
   - This is the standard Astro pattern for SSG with dynamic routes

2. **Single Post Query** (lines 23-50):
   - Fetches one post by slug with full detail including body (portable text)
   - Author reference is fully resolved: `author->{ name, title, image { image { asset, dimensions }, alt } }`
   - Featured image includes dimensions for responsive image sizing
   - All SEO fields retrieved for meta tags

3. **404 Handling** (lines 54-56):
   - If post not found, redirects to /404
   - This handles cases where slug in URL doesn't match any post

4. **SEO Fallback Logic** (lines 66-68):
   - `seoTitle` falls back to `post.title` if not set
   - `seoDescription` falls back to `post.excerpt`, then empty string
   - This ensures meta tags always have values even if SEO fields not populated

5. **Portable Text to HTML Transformation** (lines 149-203):
   - This is the MOST COMPLEX part of the news system
   - **Manual transformation** - NOT using @portabletext/react despite the import
   - Maps over `post.body` array, processing each block (lines 154-200)
   - For each block of `_type === 'block'`, processes children:
     - Maps over children array, extracting text from spans (lines 156-181)
     - Applies marks by wrapping text: 'strong' → `<strong>`, 'em' → `<em>`, 'underline' → `<u>`, 'code' → `<code>` (lines 160-175)
     - Joins all child text together (line 182)
   - Wraps content based on block.style: h1, h2, h3, h4, blockquote, or default <p> (lines 184-197)
   - Joins all blocks into single HTML string (line 201)
   - Injects via `set:html` attribute (line 153)

6. **Date Formatting** (lines 58-64):
   - Same as listing page but different format: "day numeric, month long, year numeric" (e.g., "15 January 2025")
   - Note the subtle difference: listing uses "short" month, detail uses "long" month

**Display Components:**

`PostCard.astro` (used in other contexts, NOT the news page):
- Vertical card layout with image, badge, title, body, date, "Read More" link
- Hover effects: shadow increase, scale image, underline link
- Uses ResponsiveImage with 'card' imageType

`PostListItem.astro` (used on news listing page):
- Horizontal layout: image on left (sm:w-64 md:w-80), content on right
- Image has hover scale effect (scale-110) with slow transition (500ms)
- Meta displayed as inline: "By author - date" (line 44)
- Body truncated with `line-clamp-3` CSS class
- Chevron icon animates on hover (translate-x-1)

**Image Handling Pattern:**

Both components receive image in this structure:
```typescript
{
  asset: { _ref: string } | { _id: string },
  dimensions: { width: number, height: number },
  alt: string
}
```

This is passed to ResponsiveImage which uses `getImageUrl()` and `generateSrcSet()` from `src/utils/sanity-image.ts` to:
- Generate optimized URLs with width/quality parameters
- Create responsive srcset for multiple screen sizes
- Default to WebP format with 80% quality
- Use predefined size configurations from `defaultSizes` object

### Testing the Water Quality System: What Tests Need to Cover

**Unit Tests for `transformSamplesToChartData()`:**

This function has several edge cases that MUST be tested:

1. **Null/Undefined Value Handling**:
   - Sample with `ecoli: null` should result in null in dataset (not 0, not 1)
   - Sample with `enterococci: undefined` should result in null
   - These nulls tell Chart.js to skip the point, creating intentional gaps in the line

2. **Log Scale Clamping**:
   - Value of 0 should become 1 (cannot display 0 on log scale)
   - Value of 0.5 should become 1
   - Value of 1 should stay 1
   - Value of 1000 should stay 1000
   - This is critical to prevent Chart.js errors with logarithmic axis

3. **Data Structure Validation**:
   - Output should have `labels` array with formatted dates
   - Output should have `datasets` array
   - For N sites, should have 2N datasets (one ecoli, one enterococci per site)
   - Each dataset should have label format: "{siteName} - E. coli" or "{siteName} - Enterococci"
   - Enterococci datasets should have `borderDash: [5, 5]`, ecoli should not

4. **Date Mapping**:
   - Data points should align with labels by date
   - If a site has no sample for a date, that position should be null
   - Date formatting should match component expectations: 'en-GB' locale

5. **Empty Data**:
   - Empty samples array should return empty labels and datasets (graceful degradation)

**Unit Tests for `getChartConfig()`:**

1. **Threshold Toggle**:
   - `getChartConfig(true)` should include annotation zones and lines
   - `getChartConfig(false)` should have empty annotations object
   - This controls whether EU standards are shown on chart

2. **Annotation Structure**:
   - Should have 4 zone boxes (excellent, good, sufficient, poor)
   - Should have 6 threshold lines (3 ecoli, 3 enterococci)
   - Each zone should specify yMin, yMax, backgroundColor, borderWidth: 0
   - Each line should specify yMin === yMax, borderColor, borderDash

3. **Configuration Values**:
   - Y-axis type should be 'logarithmic'
   - Tooltip callback should format as "{label}: {value} cfu/100ml" for valid values
   - Tooltip callback should format as "{label}: No data" for null values
   - Tick callback should only show labels for [1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000]

### Testing the News System: What Tests Need to Cover

**Unit Tests for Portable Text Transformation:**

The portable text to HTML conversion is completely custom and needs thorough testing:

1. **Basic Block Types**:
   - Block with style 'normal' should render as `<p>text</p>`
   - Block with style 'h1' should render as `<h1>text</h1>`
   - Same for h2, h3, h4, blockquote

2. **Text Marks**:
   - Span with mark 'strong' should wrap in `<strong>`
   - Span with mark 'em' should wrap in `<em>`
   - Span with mark 'underline' should wrap in `<u>`
   - Span with mark 'code' should wrap in `<code>`
   - Multiple marks should nest correctly (e.g., strong + em = `<strong><em>text</em></strong>`)

3. **Complex Content**:
   - Block with multiple children should join them correctly
   - Block with children having different marks should apply each independently
   - Block with no children should render empty tag (edge case)

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Empty body array should return empty string
   - Non-block types should be filtered out (return empty string per line 199)
   - Missing children array should handle gracefully

**Integration Tests for Post Rendering:**

These test the full flow from query to display:

1. **Data Fetching**:
   - Mock Sanity client to return test post data
   - Verify GROQ query structure matches expectations
   - Test author reference resolution

2. **SEO Fallback Logic**:
   - Post with seoTitle should use it
   - Post without seoTitle should fall back to title
   - Post with seoDescription should use it
   - Post without seoDescription should fall back to excerpt
   - Post without excerpt should fall back to empty string

3. **Date Formatting**:
   - Verify 'en-GB' locale formatting
   - Test with various dates to ensure consistent output
   - Test with null publishedAt (should show null gracefully)

4. **Image Data Structure**:
   - Verify image passed to ResponsiveImage has correct shape
   - Test with featuredImage present
   - Test with featuredImage missing (should not error)
   - Test with author image present/missing

**Unit Tests for `extractTextFromPortableText()`:**

This helper is used for excerpt generation:

1. **Basic Extraction**:
   - Array of blocks with text should extract and join with spaces
   - Should ignore non-block types
   - Should extract from all children in each block

2. **Truncation**:
   - Text longer than maxLength should truncate and add '...'
   - Text shorter than maxLength should return as-is
   - Truncation should happen at character boundary (not word boundary)

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Empty array should return empty string
   - Null/undefined input should return empty string
   - Blocks with no children should handle gracefully
   - Children that aren't spans should be ignored

### Technical Reference Details

#### Test File Locations

Based on existing structure, new tests should go:
- `tests/unit/water-quality.test.ts` - Unit tests for transformSamplesToChartData() and getChartConfig()
- `tests/unit/portable-text.test.ts` - Unit tests for extractTextFromPortableText() and transformation logic
- `tests/integration/news-rendering.test.ts` - Integration tests for post query and rendering flow

#### Mock Patterns to Follow

**For Water Quality Tests:**
```javascript
// Mock the Sanity client (from tests/integration/page-rendering.test.ts pattern)
vi.mock('../../src/utils/sanity-client', () => ({
  client: {
    fetch: vi.fn()
  }
}));

// Mock sample data structure
const mockSample = {
  _id: 'sample-1',
  date: '2025-01-15',
  siteName: 'Calstock',
  siteSlug: 'calstock',
  ecoli: 250,
  enterococci: 100,
  rainfall: 5.2,
  notes: 'Clear day'
};
```

**For News Tests:**
```javascript
// Mock portable text block structure
const mockBlock = {
  _type: 'block',
  style: 'normal',
  children: [
    {
      _type: 'span',
      text: 'Hello world',
      marks: ['strong']
    }
  ]
};

// Mock full post structure
const mockPost = {
  _id: 'post-1',
  title: 'Test Post',
  slug: { current: 'test-post' },
  excerpt: 'A test post',
  body: [mockBlock],
  publishedAt: '2025-01-15T10:00:00Z',
  author: {
    name: 'Test Author',
    title: 'Writer',
    image: null
  },
  featuredImage: {
    image: {
      asset: { _ref: 'image-123' },
      dimensions: { width: 1200, height: 630 }
    },
    alt: 'Test image'
  },
  seoTitle: null,
  seoDescription: null,
  seoKeywords: null
};
```

#### Data Type Definitions

From `types/index.ts`:

**WaterSample Interface** (lines 159-172):
```typescript
{
  _id: string;
  _type: 'waterSample';
  date: string; // ISO date string
  site: { _ref: string, _type: 'reference' } | SamplingSite;
  ecoli?: number | null;
  enterococci?: number | null;
  rainfall?: number | null;
  notes?: string;
  labReference?: string;
}
```

**Post Structure** (from schema):
```typescript
{
  _id: string;
  title: string;
  slug: { current: string };
  excerpt?: string;
  body: Array<{
    _type: 'block';
    style: 'h1' | 'h2' | 'h3' | 'h4' | 'blockquote' | 'normal';
    children: Array<{
      _type: 'span';
      text: string;
      marks?: string[];
    }>;
  }>;
  publishedAt: string; // ISO datetime string
  author?: {
    name: string;
    title?: string;
    image?: CustomImage;
  };
  featuredImage?: {
    image: {
      asset: { _ref: string };
      dimensions: { width: number; height: number };
    };
    alt: string;
  };
  seoTitle?: string;
  seoDescription?: string;
  seoKeywords?: string;
}
```

#### Chart.js Data Format Expected

```typescript
{
  labels: string[]; // Formatted date strings
  datasets: Array<{
    label: string; // "SiteName - BacteriaType"
    data: (number | null)[]; // Aligned with labels, null for gaps
    tension: number; // 0.3 for smooth curves
    borderWidth: number; // 2
    borderDash?: [number, number]; // [5, 5] for enterococci only
    pointRadius: number; // 3
    pointHoverRadius: number; // 5
    borderColor?: string; // Applied client-side
    backgroundColor?: string; // Applied client-side
  }>;
}
```

#### Vitest Assertions to Use

Based on existing tests:
- `expect(value).toBe(expected)` - Strict equality
- `expect(value).toBeDefined()` / `.toBeNull()` / `.toBeUndefined()`
- `expect(array).toHaveLength(n)`
- `expect(object).toHaveProperty('key')`
- `expect(object).toEqual(expected)` - Deep equality
- `expect(object).toMatchObject(partial)` - Partial match
- `expect(string).toContain(substring)`
- `expect(fn).toThrow(error)`
- `expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalledWith(args)`

#### Coverage Goals

The existing test suite has good coverage of utilities and integration points. New tests should:
1. Maintain or improve overall coverage percentage
2. Cover all edge cases in data transformation functions
3. Include both happy path and error scenarios
4. Test null/undefined handling comprehensively
5. Verify data structure contracts between components
