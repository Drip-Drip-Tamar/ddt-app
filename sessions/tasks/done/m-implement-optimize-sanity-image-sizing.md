# Optimize Sanity Image Sizing Implementation

## Problem/Goal
The application is currently fetching raw, unoptimized images from Sanity using `image.asset->url` which returns full-resolution images without any size constraints. This leads to unnecessarily large image downloads, poor performance on slower connections, potential bandwidth overages on Sanity's CDN, and no responsive image optimization.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Install and configure @sanity/image-url package
- [x] Create centralized image URL builder utility
- [x] Update data queries to preserve asset references
- [x] Implement responsive image generation with srcset in ResponsiveImage
- [x] Add automatic format optimization (WebP/AVIF)
- [x] Update all components to pass asset references and use imageType
- [x] Fix BackgroundImage component to use optimized URLs
- [x] Update Layout meta tags for optimized social images
- [x] Verify images load with appropriate sizes for different viewports
- [ ] Confirm performance improvements with Lighthouse

## Context Manifest

### Sanity Image Optimization Implementation - Completed

A comprehensive image optimization system has been successfully implemented for Sanity assets, providing automatic responsive image generation, format optimization, and smart cropping capabilities.

#### Core Architecture

**Sanity Image URL Builder (`src/utils/sanity-image.ts`)**: 
Complete utility suite built on `@sanity/image-url` package providing:
- `urlFor()` - Base URL builder for Sanity images
- `getImageUrl()` - Single optimized URL generation with width, height, quality, and format options  
- `generateSrcSet()` - Responsive srcset generation for breakpoints [320, 480, 640, 768, 1024, 1200, 1920]w
- `generateSizes()` - Dynamic sizes attribute generation for responsive layouts
- `defaultSizes` - Pre-configured responsive sizes for card, hero, logo, and avatar use cases
- `isSanityImage()` - Asset reference detection utility

**Data Integration (`src/data/blocks.js`)**:
Updated IMAGE fragment preserves asset references with full metadata:
```groq
{
  "_id": image.asset->_id,
  "asset": image.asset,
  "dimensions": image.asset->metadata.dimensions, 
  "alt": alt,
  "hotspot": image.hotspot,
  "crop": image.crop
}
```

**Component Architecture (`src/components/ResponsiveImage.astro`)**:
Unified image component with intelligent dual-path rendering:
- Sanity images: Generate responsive srcset with format optimization
- Local images: Use Astro's native Image component
- Visual editing: Preserve all annotation attributes
- Type safety: Support for imageType presets (card, hero, logo, avatar)

#### Implementation Features

**Performance Optimization**:
- Automatic format selection (WebP with JPEG fallback)
- Quality optimization (80% default, customizable per use case)
- Responsive breakpoints covering mobile to desktop (320px-1920px)
- Lazy loading with configurable loading strategies
- Smart cropping using Sanity hotspot and crop data

**Component Integration**:
- **ResponsiveImage**: Handles both Sanity and local images with automatic detection
- **BackgroundImage**: Optimized CSS backgrounds at 1920px width with 85% quality
- **Layout**: Social media meta images optimized to 1200x630 for OG standards
- **All components**: Updated to pass asset references and appropriate imageType values

**Developer Experience**:
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing `src` URLs
- Type-safe interfaces with proper Sanity types
- Visual editing annotations preserved throughout
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks

## User Notes
<!-- Any specific notes or requirements from the developer -->
- Use web search to understand the problem and best practices
- Leverage Sanity's image CDN capabilities
- Maintain compatibility with existing Astro Image component for local images

## Work Log

### 2025-09-11 - Initial Implementation

#### Completed
- Researched Sanity image optimization best practices and CDN capabilities
- Installed and configured `@sanity/image-url` package (v1.2.0)
- Created comprehensive image utility suite at `src/utils/sanity-image.ts`
- Updated `src/data/blocks.js` IMAGE fragment to preserve asset references (breaking change from raw URLs)
- Enhanced ResponsiveImage component with intelligent Sanity/non-Sanity detection
- Added responsive srcset generation with 7 breakpoints (320px-1920px)
- Implemented automatic format optimization (WebP with JPEG fallback)
- Created imageType presets for card, hero, logo, and avatar use cases

#### Architecture Decisions
- Dual-path rendering: Sanity images use responsive srcset, local images use Astro Image component
- Backward compatibility: Component accepts both asset references and raw URLs
- Visual editing: Preserved all data-sb-field-path annotations throughout
- Performance: URL generation at render time with quality and format controls

### 2025-09-12 - Component Integration & Completion

#### Completed
- Fixed ResponsiveImage to handle missing src when asset is provided
- Improved isSanityImage detection logic for robust asset identification
- Updated all image-using components with asset references and imageType props:
  - Card.astro: Added asset prop and imageType="card"
  - Header.astro: Added asset prop and imageType="logo"
  - LogoStripStatic.astro: Added asset prop and imageType="logo"
  - LogoStripAnimated.astro: Added asset prop and imageType="logo" for both strips
  - Testimonial.astro: Added asset props and imageType for both company logos and author avatars
- Enhanced BackgroundImage component to use optimized URLs (1920px width, 85% quality)
- Updated Layout component for optimized social media meta images (1200x630 OG standard)
- Verified responsive images working with proper srcset and sizes attributes
- Confirmed all success criteria met except Lighthouse performance audit

#### Technical Implementation
- **Package Installation**: `@sanity/image-url@^1.2.0` added to dependencies
- **Data Queries**: IMAGE fragment now preserves full asset metadata including hotspot/crop
- **Component Updates**: 10 components updated with optimized image handling
- **Performance Features**: Format optimization, quality control, responsive breakpoints
- **Developer Experience**: Type-safe interfaces, error handling, visual editing support

#### Final Status
- All success criteria completed except Lighthouse performance audit (deferred to separate task)
- Implementation ready for production use with comprehensive optimization
- Backward compatibility maintained throughout migration
- Full visual editing support preserved for both Sanity and Stackbit
